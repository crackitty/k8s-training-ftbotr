# Kubernetes Architecture

Let's now take a very simplified look at the Kubernetes architecture from a users
point of view.

## General Overview

Kubernetes

The following diagram shows a cluster setup where we have a Master in one location
and 3 worker nodes (where our deployment will end up) in a different location.

For instance, the master could be in the cloud and the workers could be on-prem.

## Hands on training

So, now we'll get into doing some actual work with what we've learned using the `kubectl`
command line tool.
