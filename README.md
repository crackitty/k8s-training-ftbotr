# Kubernetes Training material

These sessions will be interactive so the first thing you need to do is
clone this repo onto your local computer and we will work from there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crackitty/k8s-training-ftbotr
```

After cloning the repo, you can then pick whichever topic you want to learn.

Currently the available courses are as follows:
