# Kubernetes Training material

These sessions will be interactive so the first thing you need to do is
clone this repo onto your local computer and we will work from there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crackitty/k8s-training-ftbotr
```

After cloning the repo, you can then pick whichever topic you want to learn.

Currently the available courses are as follows:

- [Kubernetes Deployments](./deployments/exercises/intro.md)

## Training

The training is expected to be done in groups of two or more so there will
be parts that, if you are doing this on your own, you can skip, but it is
recommended to do these in order to reinforce the concepts.


**Note:** This is an ongoing development and new modules will be added
